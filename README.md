# Tetroggle

This is a re-implementation of a game I made for my mom a couple years ago when I was a new programmer, and an opportunity for me to get my hands dirty with [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/). Beware that the code is super nasty, since I finished hacking the thing together on Christmas vacation after a few months working on it an hour or so a week.
